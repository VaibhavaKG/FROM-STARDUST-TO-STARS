Stars are born within vast cosmic clouds, where gravity draws gas and dust together until nuclear fusion ignites at the core. They then spend most of their lives shining steadily, powered by the fusion of lighter elements into heavier ones. Eventually, every star reaches an end dictated by its mass. Smaller stars fade into white dwarfs, while massive ones die in dramatic explosions that leave behind neutron stars or black holes. These deaths scatter newly formed elements across space, enriching galaxies and providing the raw material for planets and life. In this way, the story of stars is also our own: we are made from the remnants of their ancient light.
